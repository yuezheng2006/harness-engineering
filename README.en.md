# Harness Engineering Study Guide

> A deep-dive learning archive on Harness Engineering — from concept to practice

## Introduction

This is an evolving learning project. **Harness Engineering** is an engineering paradigm proposed by OpenAI in February 2026: engineers stop writing code and instead design environments, clarify intent, and build feedback loops so AI agents can work reliably.

> **Humans steer. Agents execute.**

This repository documents the full learning journey — from reading the original article, breaking down concepts, forming independent thoughts, hands-on experiments, to producing shareable work. We hope it helps others exploring AI-native engineering.

## ⚡ In One Sentence

```
Traditional:          Humans write code → Machines run code
Harness Engineering:  Humans design constraints → Agents write code → Machines run code
```

The core shift: **an engineer's output moves from code to constraint systems** — AGENTS.md, architecture rules, custom linters, and feedback loops.

## 🧭 Six Core Concepts

<details>
<summary><b>1. Repo as System of Record</b> — If it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist for the agent</summary>

Slack threads, Google Docs, knowledge in people's heads = invisible to the agent. All decisions, specs, and plans must be committed as versioned artifacts.

→ See [concepts/01-repo-as-source-of-truth.md](concepts/01-repo-as-source-of-truth.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. Map, Not Manual</b> — AGENTS.md is a table of contents, not an encyclopedia</summary>

A ~100-line entry file pointing to deeper docs. Progressive disclosure: the agent starts from a small, stable entry point and is guided where to look next. Three ways a giant instruction file fails: crowds out context, impossible to maintain, can't be mechanically verified.

→ See [concepts/00-overview.md](concepts/00-overview.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. Mechanical Enforcement</b> — Docs rot; lint rules don't</summary>

Custom linters + structural tests = invariant guardians. Lint error messages embed fix instructions so agents can self-correct. Enforce boundaries centrally, allow autonomy locally.

→ See [concepts/02-mechanical-enforcement.md](concepts/02-mechanical-enforcement.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. Agent Readability</b> — Optimize for the agent's ability to reason</summary>

Prefer "boring" technologies (stable APIs, well-represented in training data). Sometimes re-implementing a focused subset is cheaper than wrapping opaque upstream behavior. Make the app launchable per git worktree.

→ See [concepts/04-agent-readability.md](concepts/04-agent-readability.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. Throughput Changes Merge Philosophy</b> — Correction is cheap; waiting is expensive</summary>

Short PR lifecycles. Flaky tests resolved by re-runs rather than blocking indefinitely. In a system where agent throughput far exceeds human attention, this is usually the right call.

→ See [concepts/05-throughput-changes-merge.md](concepts/05-throughput-changes-merge.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>6. Entropy Management = Garbage Collection</b> — Tech debt is a high-interest loan</summary>

Agents reproduce existing patterns in the repo — including bad ones. Codify "golden rules" into the repo. Run periodic background tasks to scan for drift, update quality scores, and open targeted refactoring PRs.

→ See [concepts/03-entropy-and-garbage-collection.md](concepts/03-entropy-and-garbage-collection.md)

Each subdirectory has its own `AGENTS.md` explaining its purpose and conventions — a direct practice of the "progressive disclosure" principle from the original article.

## 🚀 Learning Path

- [x] **Phase 1: Understand core concepts** — 7 concept notes covering OpenAI's six concepts + Fowler's control-theory extension
- [x] **Phase 2: Form your own opinions** — 6 independent analyses (ongoing)
- [x] **Phase 3: Pick a small project to practice** — Ralph Demo completed (321s, $0.31)
- [x] **Phase 4: Record feedback & iterations** — 1 article (ongoing)
- [x] **Phase 5: Produce shareable work** — 11 professional translations

| Backpressure Over Prescription | Mechanical Enforcement — don't prescribe how; gate bad output |
| The Plan Is Disposable | Entropy Management — regeneration costs one planning loop |
| Disk Is State, Git Is Memory | Repo as System of Record — files are the handoff mechanism |
| Steer With Signals, Not Scripts | Humans Steer — add signs, not scripts |
| Let Ralph Ralph | Agents Execute — sit on the loop, not in it |
